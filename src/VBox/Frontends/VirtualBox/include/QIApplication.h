/** Sligtly modified QApplication class.
 *
 *  The sole purpose of this class (ATM) is to hook the macEventFilter
 *  in order to intercept Command-Q, Command-H and similar menu hot-keys
 *  before the HI Manager translate them into (menu) command events and
 *  start blinking menus in the menu bar.
 *
 * @remark
 *  A special hack in qeventloop_mac.cpp is required for this
 *  to work. Overloading QEventLoop::processEvents isn't feasable
 *  unfortunately, thus the horrible hacks. Qt 4 does seem to provide
 *  an interface similar to the one we create here.
 *
 *  Btw. is QI* the right right way to do this? Or should it perhapse
 *  be called VBoxQApplication or something?
