/** @page pg_dbgf_addr_space     DBGFAddrSpace - Address Space Management
 *
 * What's an address space? It's mainly a convenient way of stuffing
 * module segments and ad-hoc symbols together. It will also help out
 * when the debugger gets extended to deal with user processes later.
 *
 * There are two standard address spaces that will always be present:
 *   - The physical address space.
 *   - The global virtual address space.
 *
 * Additional address spaces will be added and removed at runtime for
 * guest processes. The global virtual address space will be used to
 * track the kernel parts of the OS, or at least the bits of the kernel
 * that is part of all address spaces (mac os x and 4G/4G patched linux).
