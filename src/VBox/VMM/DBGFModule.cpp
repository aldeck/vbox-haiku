/** @page pg_dbgf_module    DBGFModule - Module & Segment Management
 *
 * A module is our representation of an executable binary. It's main purpose
 * is to provide segments that can be mapped into address spaces and thereby
 * provide debug info for those parts for the guest code or data.
 *
 * This module will not deal directly with debug info, it will only serve
 * as an interface between the debugger / symbol lookup and the debug info
 * readers.
 *
 * An executable binary doesn't need to have a file, or that is, we don't
 * need the file to create a module for it. There will be interfaces for
 * ROMs to register themselves so we can get to their symbols, and there
 * will be interfaces for the guest OS plugins (@see pg_dbgf_os) to
 * register kernel, drivers and other global modules.
