/**
 *  Template class to manage allocation/deallocation of data structures on the
 *  heap with the ability to share allocated data among several instances.
 *
 *  Data sharing is implemented using the concept of reference counting.
 *  When an instance allocates the managed data structure from scratch, it sets
 *  the reference counter to one. When it starts sharing the existing data
 *  structure, it simply increments the reference counter by one. When it stops
 *  sharing data, the reference counter is decremented. Once this counter drops
 *  to zero, the managed data structure is automatically deallocated (deleted).
 *
 *  Data managed by instances of this class can be either |NULL| (not allocated
 *  and not shared) or non-|NULL| (either allocated using #create() or shared
 *  with another instance using one of assignment operators or methods), as
 *  indicated by the #isNull() method and by the data pointer returned by
 *  the #data() method. Note that the #operator->() method will fail (hit an
 *  assertion) if the managed data pointer is |NULL|.
 *
 *  The managed data structure (passed as the first argument to the template)
 *  must meet the following requirements:
 *  <ul>
 *      <li>Must have a public default constructor (with no arguments)
 *      <li>Must define a public copy constructor and assignment operation
 *  </ul>
 *
 *  This template class is NOT thread-safe. If you need thread safefy, you can
 *  specify util::Lockable as the second argument to the template. In this
 *  case, you can explicitly lock instances of the template (using the
 *  AutoWriteLock and AutoReadLock classes) before accessing any of its
 *  members, as follows:
 *  <code>
 *      struct Data { ... };
 *      Shareable <Data, util::Lockable> mData;
 *      ...
 *      {
 *          // acquire the lock until the end of the block
 *          AutoWriteLock alock(mData COMMA_LOCKVAL_SRC_POS);
 *          // share with another instance (thatData defined somewhere else)
 *          {
 *              AutoReadLock thatLock(thatData COMMA_LOCKVAL_SRC_POS);
 *              mData = thatData;
 *          }
 *          // access managed data (through #operator->())
 *          mData->mSomeVield = someValue;
 *      }
 *  </code>
 *
 *  Making this class thread-safe usually assumes that the managed data
 *  structure must be also thread-safe and must share its own lock object with
 *  all other Shareable instances referring it (so locking it through one
 *  Shareable instance will prevent another one sharing the same data from
 *  accessing it). This can be done in a similar way by deriving the data
 *  structure to manage from util::Lockable and using the #data() method to
 *  lock it before accessing:
 *  <code>
 *      struct Data : public util::Lockable { ... };
 *      Shareable <Data, util::Lockable> mData;
 *      ...
 *      {
 *          // read-only data access
 *          AutoReadLock lock(mData COMMA_LOCKVAL_SRC_POS); // protect Shareable members (read-only)
 *          AutoReadLock dataLock(mData.data() COMMA_LOCKVAL_SRC_POS); // protect Data members (read-only)
 *          if (mData->mSomeVield) ...
 *      }
 *      ...
 *      {
 *          // data modification
 *          AutoReadLock lock(mData COMMA_LOCKVAL_SRC_POS); // protect Shareable members (still read-only)
 *          AutoWriteLock dataLock(mData.data() COMMA_LOCKVAL_SRC_POS); // protect Data members (exclusive)
 *          mData->mSomeVield = someValue;
 *      }
 *  </code>
 *
 *  Please note that if you want to access managed data through #data() or
 *  #operator->(), you have to enter both locks! If you only need to access
 *  Shareable members themselves (i.e. to assign one Shareable to another or to
 *  call #setNull()) it's enough to enter the Shareable lock only (as it's shown
 *  at the beginning of the first example).
 *
