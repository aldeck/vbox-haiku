Guest Additions Installation/Usage Instructions for Haiku
---------------------------------------------------------

These are temporary instructions for those who want to test the Haiku port
of the guest additions before a proper package or installer has been created.

== You will need: ==
- The contents of this repository
- A GCC4-based Haiku installation with development tools installed

== To compile the guest additions: ==
./configure --build-headless --disable-python --disable-java
kmk VBOX_ONLY_ADDITIONS=1 VBOX_WITH_ADDITION_DRIVERS=1 all

If the build fails complaining about 'ev' being undefined, edit
out/haiku.x86/release/revision.kmk and change 'ev' to 9001 - this is due to
the code for finding the Subversion revision not working with Git repos.

== To install: ==
mkdir -p ~/config/add-ons/kernel/generic/
cp out/haiku.x86/release/bin/additions/vboxguest ~/config/add-ons/kernel/generic/

mkdir -p ~/config/add-ons/kernel/drivers/dev/misc/
cp out/haiku.x86/release/bin/additions/vboxdev ~/config/add-ons/kernel/drivers/bin/
ln -s ../../bin/vboxdev ~/config/add-ons/kernel/drivers/dev/misc/

mkdir -p ~/config/add-ons/kernel/file_systems/
cp out/haiku.x86/release/bin/additions/vboxsf ~/config/add-ons/kernel/file_systems/
cp out/haiku.x86/release/bin/additions/VBoxMouse ~/config/add-ons/input_server/devices/

mkdir -p /boot/apps/VBoxAdditions/
cp out/haiku.x86/release/bin/additions/VBoxService /boot/apps/VBoxAdditions/
cp out/haiku.x86/release/bin/additions/VBoxTray /boot/apps/VBoxAdditions/
ln -s /boot/apps/VBoxAdditions/VBoxService ~/config/boot/launch

/boot/apps/VBoxAdditions/VBoxService
/boot/apps/VBoxAdditions/VBoxTray

== To uninstall: ==
rm -Rf /boot/apps/VBoxAdditions
rm ~/config/add-ons/input_server/devices/VBoxMouse
rm ~/config/add-ons/kernel/file_systems/vboxsf
rm ~/config/add-ons/kernel/drivers/dev/misc/vboxdev
rm ~/config/add-ons/kernel/drivers/bin/vboxdev
rm ~/config/add-ons/kernel/generic/vboxguest

== Usage: ==
Time synchronization and clipboard sharing are done by VBoxService and
VBoxTray respectively - once they have been started you do not need to do
anything special to use them.

To mount a shared folder, tell Haiku to mount a null filesystem of type
'vboxsf' and pass the share name as a parameter:

mount -t vboxsf -p SharedFolderFullOfLolcats /mountpoint
