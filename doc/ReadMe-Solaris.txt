Sun xVM VirtualBox for OpenSolaris (TM) Operating System
--------------------------------------------------------

Upgrading:
----------

If you have an existing VirtualBox installation and you are upgrading to a newer version of
VirtualBox, please uninstall the previous version completely before installing a newer one.

You should uninstall BOTH the VirtualBox base package as well as the VirtualBox kernel
interface package before installing the new ones.

Please refer to the "Uninstallation" section at the end of this document for the details.


Installing:
-----------

After extracting the contents of the tar.gz file perform the following steps:

1. Login as root using the "su" command.

2. Install the packages (in this order):

   (*) First, the VirtualBox kernel interface package:
   
        pkgadd -G -d VirtualBoxKern-@VBOX_VERSION_STRING@-SunOS-r@VBOX_SVN_REV@.pkg

        To perform an unattended (non-interactive) installation of this package add
        "-n -a autoresponse SUNWvboxkern" (without quotes) to the end of the above pkgadd command.

   (*) Next, the main VirtualBox package:

        pkgadd -d VirtualBox-@VBOX_VERSION_STRING@-SunOS-r@VBOX_SVN_REV@.pkg

        To perform an unattended (non-interactive) installation of this package add
        "-n -a autoresponse SUNWvbox" (without quotes) to the end of the above pkgadd command.

3. For each package the installer would ask you to "Select package(s) you wish to process"
        For this type "1" or "all".

4. Then type "y" when asked about continuing with the installation.

Now all the necessary files would be installed on your system. Start VirtualBox by typing
VirtualBox from the terminal.


Uninstalling:
-------------

To remove VirtualBox from your system perform the following steps:

1. Login as root using the "su" command.

2. Run the command:
        pkgrm SUNWvbox

To remove the VirtualBox kernel interface module run the command:
        pkgrm SUNWvboxkern
