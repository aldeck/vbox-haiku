 *  A simple std::auto_ptr extension that adds CopyConstructible and
 *  Assignable semantics.
 *
 *  Instances of this class, when constructed from or assigned with instances
 *  of the same class, create a copy of the managed object using the new
 *  operator and the managed object's copy constructor, as opposed to
 *  std::auto_ptr which simply transfers ownership in these cases.
 *
 *  This template is useful for member variables of a class that store
 *  dynamically allocated instances of some other class and these instances
 *  need to be copied when the containing class instance is copied itself.
 *
 *  Be careful when returning instances of this class by value: it will call
 *  cause to create a copy of the managed object which is probably is not what
 *  you want, especially if its constructor is quite an expensive operation.
