Template: virtualbox-ose/group-vboxusers
Type: note
Description: Creating group 'vboxusers'
 Users of VirtualBox must be member of that group in order to have write
 permissions to /dev/vboxdrv. Otherwise starting of VMs will not be possible.

Template: virtualbox-ose/module-compilation-failed
Type: note
Description: Compilation of the kernel module FAILED!
 VirtualBox will not start until this problem is fixed. Please consult
 /var/log/vbox-install.log to find out why the kernel module does not compile.
 Most probably the kernel sources were not found. Install them and execute
   
   /etc/init.d/vboxdrv setup
   
 as root.

Template: virtualbox-ose/module-compilation-allowed
Type: boolean
Default: true
Description: Should the vboxdrv kernel module be compiled now?
 Unable to find a precompiled module for the current kernel!
 .
 Without a suitable kernel module you will never be able to start VMs. It is
 strongly recommended to compile a kernel module now. The kernel headers and
 the tools to build kernel modules (gcc, make, binutils, ...) are required.
 However, in case a suitable kernel module already exists at another place you
 might want to override the default position by setting KDIR=<full_path_to_vboxdrv_module>
 in /etc/default/virtualbox-ose. The compilation can also be done later by executing
   
   /etc/init.d/vboxdrv setup
   
 as root.

Template: virtualbox-ose/delete-old-modules
Type: boolean
Default: true
Description: Delete old modules?
 Old vboxdrv modules found. It is recommended to purge these modules as they might not
 work together with this version of VirtualBox. The module re-compilation can be
 forced later by executing
   
   /etc/init.d/vboxdrv setup
   
 as root

Template: virtualbox-ose/update_version_change
Type: boolean
Default: false
Description: Proceed with VirtualBox upgrade?
 You are about to update VirtualBox to a new upstream version. Make sure to discard or
 merge all snapshots and saved states before you proceed because VM states are version
 specific.

Template: virtualbox-ose/old-installation-found
Type: note
Description: Old installation found
 An old installation of VirtualBox was found. To install this package the old package
 has to be removed first. Have a look at /etc/vbox/vbox.cfg to determine the installation
 directory of the previous installation. After uninstalling the old package remove the file
 /etc/vbox/vbox.cfg.
